## Ether Wallet
Ethereum wallets are applications that let you interact with your Ethereum account. Think of it like an internet banking app â€“ without the bank. Your wallet lets you read your balance, send transactions and connect to applications.

The owner's address is listed first in the contract.
```solidity
address payable public owner;
```
The address has the designation payable so that ether can be sent to it.

The owner variable in the constructor is set to `msg.sender`, or the deployer of the contract, upon initialization.
```solidity
constructor() {
    owner = payable(msg.sender);
}
```

We now have two unique functions called `receive` and `fallback` that allow the contract to accept plain ether with or without a calldata. For more information on these functions, read on.
```solidity
receive() external payable {}
fallback() external payable {}
```
Following this, we require a function to withdraw our ether to the address of the owner; the withdraw function aids us in doing this. It has a require statement that makes that the owner, whom we initialised in the constructor, is the one calling the method. We transfer ether from the smart contract to the msg.sender if that criterion is satisfied.
```solidity
function withdraw(uint _amount) external {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "caller is not owner");
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(_amount);
}
```
Finally, we create a new function named getBalance, which is a view function, meaning that anyone can call it to retrieve the smart contract's balance without affecting the blockchain's current state.
```solidity
function getBalance() external view returns (uint) {
    return address(this).balance;
}
```

    constructor() {
        owner = payable(msg.sender);

    receive() external payable {}

    function withdraw(uint _amount) external {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "caller is not owner");
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(_amount);
    }

    function getBalance() external view returns (uint) {
        return address(this).balance;
    }
}

```
